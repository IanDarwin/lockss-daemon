<Abstract>Bone loss associated with degenerative disease and trauma is a clinical problem increasing with the aging population. Thus, effective bone augmentation strategies are required; however, many have the disadvantages that they require invasive surgery and often the addition of expensive growth factors to induce osteoblast differentiation. Here, we investigated a LaponiteÒ crosslinked, pNIPAM-DMAc copolymer (L-pNIPAM-co-DMAc) hydrogel with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HAPna), which can be maintained as a liquid ex vivo, injected via narrow-gauge needle into affected bone, followed by in situ gelation to deliver and induce osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). L-pNIPAM-co-DMAc hydrogels were synthesised and HAPna added post polymerisation. Commercial hMSCs from one donor (Lonza) were incorporated in liquid hydrogel, the mixture solidified and cultured for up to 6 weeks. Viability of hMSCs was maintained within hydrogel constructs containing 0.5 mg/mL HAPna. SEM analysis demonstrated matrix deposition in cellular hydrogels which were absent in acellular controls. A significant increase in storage modulus (G') was observed in cellular hydrogels with 0.5 mg/mL HAPna. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry and histological analysis demonstrated that bone differentiation markers and collagen deposition was induced within 48 h, with increased calcium deposition with time. The thermally triggered hydrogel system, described here, was sufficient without the need of additional growth factors or osteogenic media to induce osteogenic differentiation of commercial hMSCs. Preliminary data presented here will be expanded on multiple patient samples to ensure differentiation is seen in these samples. This system could potentially reduce treatment costs and simplify the treatment strategy for orthopaedic repair and regeneration.</Abstract>

<Abstract>Transplantation may be the best option for the repair of many cartilage lesions including early osteoarthritis. Currently, autologous and allogeneic chondrocytes are grafted into cartilage defects to treat selected patients with moderate clinical success. However, their limited use justifies exploring novel therapies for cartilage repair. Xenotransplantation could become a solution by offering high cell availability, quality and genetic engineering capabilities. The rejection process of xenogeneic cartilage is thus being elucidated in order to develop counteractive strategies. Initial studies determined that pig cartilage xenografts are rejected by a slow process comprising humoral and cellular responses in which the galactose α1,3-galactose antigen participates. Since then, our group has identified key mechanisms of the human response to pig chondrocytes (PCs). In particular, human antibody and complement contribute to PC rejection by inducing a pro-inflammatory milieu. Furthermore, PCs express and up-regulate molecules which are functionally relevant for a variety of cellular immune responses (SLA-I, the potent co-stimulatory molecule CD86, and adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1). These participate by triggering a T cell response, as well as supporting a prominent role of the innate immune responses led by natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes/macrophages. Human NK cells lyse PCs by using selected NK activating receptors, whereas human monocytes are activated by PCs to secrete cytokines and chemokines. All this knowledge sets the bases for the development of genetic engineering approaches designed to avert rejection of xenogeneic chondrocytes and leads the way to developing new clinical applications for cartilage repair.</Abstract>

<Abstract>The aim of this study was to immunolocalise type VI collagen and perlecan and determine their interactive properties in the intervertebral disc (IVD). Confocal laser scanning microscopy co-localised perlecan with type VI collagen as pericellular components of IVD cells and translamellar cross-bridges in ovine and murine IVDs. These cross-bridges were significantly less abundant in the heparin sulphate deficient Hspg2 exon 3 null mouse IVD than in wild type. This association of type VI collagen with elastic components provides clues as to its roles in conveying elastic recoil properties to annular tissues. Perlecan and type VI collagen were highly interactive in plasmon resonance studies. Pericellular colocalisation of perlecan and type VI collagen provides matrix stabilisation and cell-matrix communication which allows IVD cells to perceive and respond to perturbations in their biomechanical microenvironment. Perlecan, at the cell surface, provides an adhesive interface between the cell and its surrounding extracellular matrix. Elastic microfibrillar structures regulate tensional connective tissue development and function. The 2010 Global Burden of Disease study examined 291 disorders and identified disc degeneration and associated low back pain as the leading global musculoskeletal disorder emphasising its massive socioeconomic impact and the need for more effective treatment strategies. A greater understanding of how the IVD achieves its unique biomechanical functional properties is of great importance in the development of such therapeutic measures.</Abstract>
