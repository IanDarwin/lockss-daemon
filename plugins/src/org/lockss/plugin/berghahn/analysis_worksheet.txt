notes:  
1. Have not yet found full text html example across the journals to check images, figures
2. Do not use url consumer - get both the downloadpdf XML and PDF suffix versions
3. There is a wonky link

Abstract tab is foo.xml
PDF tab link is foo.xml?pdfVersion=true
but when on the Pdf tab, the pdf tab is a new link:
   foo.xml?&pdfVersion=true
   which looks like an error - maybe crawl rule out or does it not matter
