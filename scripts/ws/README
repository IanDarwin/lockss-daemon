The _types.py and _clients.py files in this directory must be kept in synch
with the WSDL for the corresponding daemon services.  If the service
changes in a way that changes the WSDL, the _types.py and _clients.py files
must be regenerated using wsdl2py.  If the files for either
DaemonStatusServiceImplService or HasherServiceImplService are regenerated,
the corresponding .patch files must be applied to the result.
